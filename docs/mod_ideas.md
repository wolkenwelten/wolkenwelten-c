# Ideas for some Mods
These should be quite simple to implement or require features that would improve
the base Game as well. Might also help with testing the Engine because the base
Game is still so incomplete.


## Grapple Racer
Players need to use the Grappling Hook to Race to the Finishing Line, maybe even add some Mario Kart like
"Weapons" that one might pick up in the middle to interfere with each others Grappling.

## Mobile Suit Arena Shooter
Should play in an Asteroid Belt where players control Mechas and shoot Rockets/Lasers
at each other in Zero-G or maybe even go for some close-quarters combat with Laser Scythes or something.
Needs Massive Explosions, LOTS of Lasers and some Japanese SFX.

## Gateway
A couple of 3D Physics Puzzles that a player can master using a Gateway Gun that connects
two points in the world (totally not Portal!).
