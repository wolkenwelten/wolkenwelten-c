# Just a list of things this game will NOT have:

- No Winning / Ending
Players can just play in their world for as long as they please, of course, there
are many  ways to loose :)

- No Mining / Spelunking
Players should not have to spend hours just holding down their left mouse button
in search for some rare Materials. Instead, rare items should be rare because they
require a lot of skill to acquire, not just pure chance.

- No Factories / Redstone
While building Factories/Redstone circuits is quite fun, there are a lot of other
Games out there that are a lot better at it than what I might produce.

- No Dialogue / In-Game writings (Environmental storytelling only)
This is mostly because I want to focus on procedural generation, which makes
classical storytelling quite a bit harder to pull off.

- No Worldfreeze when no player is around (only if no "living" thing is around due to technical limitations)
The world should just keep on turning, even if no player is around to witness it.
For the sake of performance a lot of the world needs to be frozen to disk though,
although I will try an experiment with ways to still have some things happen in
those frozen chunks.

- No Weapon Durability
This is just not a fun mechanic and takes away some of the fun of acquiring fancy
new equipment since you can't just start using that nice item for the fear of
wearing it down too soon. I saw this in a lot of Minecraft games where players
would just mine using Stone Pickaxes because they wanted to save the Ingots/Diamonds.

- No Fasttravel
Instead thought should be put into making traveling an enjoyable experience.
