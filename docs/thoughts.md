- NPCs? Maybe something like Terraria where one controls a "town"
Since every block can be changed enabling players to build houses, plazas and whole towns it could
be nice to nudge players into building a town since without npcs living in those houses and offering services
building towns could/would be seen as a waste from a pure gameplay perspective

- Fancy Grass "Blocks" / Crops?
For once they do quite a lot to reduce the blocky appearance, although this
would mean more code in the renderpath. How could farming crops be rendered apart from
angled billboards? 3D Models would be quite a bit of work for every crop although giving much more freedom whilst
most probably destroying performance without massive optimization work. Needs some more thought for now.
