Fast travel?
	Questionable if needed due to Grappling Hook and Gliders, although some kind of infrastructure
	projects for players could be fun
Tool/Weapon durability?
	Seems to mostly be a hassle and not adding much fun while leading some players
	to not use the materials they have for fear of wasting them (eg. Seb not using iron pickaxes in Minecraft)
Art Style?
	Currently too similar to Minecraft, the game needs to find its tone/color.
	Probably should be as bright and colorful as Minecraft/Zelda to underline the abstract/cartoonish graphics necessiated by the voxel/blocks
NPCs? Maybe something like Terraria where one controls a "town"
	Since every block can be changed enabling players to build houses, plazas and whole towns it could
	be nice to nudge players into building a town since without npcs living in those houses and offering services
	building towns could/would be seen as a waste from a pure gameplay perspective
Fancy Grass "Blocks" / Crops?
	For once they do quite a lot to reduce the blocky appearance, although this
	would mean more code in the renderpath. How could farming crops be rendered apart from
	angled billboards? 3D Models would be quite a bit of work for every crop although giving much more freedom whilst
	most probably destroying performance without massive optimization work. Needs some more thought for now.
Speedlines?
	Quite a lot of anime/mangas use speedlines to their advantage, might be useful here to underline the speed and agility
	with which one jumps from island to island.
