Fast travel?
	Questionable if needed due to Grappling Hook and Gliders, although some kind of infrastructure
	projects for players could be fun
Tool/Weapon durability?
	Seems to mostly be a hassle and not adding much fun while leading some players
	to not use the materials they have for fear of wasting them (eg. S not using iron pickaxes in Minecraft)
Art Style?
	Currently too similar to Minecraft, the game needs to find its tone/color.
	Probably should be as bright and colorful as Minecraft/Zelda to underline the abstract/cartoonish graphics necessiated by the voxel/blocks
NPCs? Maybe something like Terraria where one controls a "town"
	Since every block can be changed enabling players to build houses, plazas and whole towns it could
	be nice to nudge players into building a town since without npcs living in those houses and offering services
	building towns could/would be seen as a waste from a pure gameplay perspective
Positional Audio?
	Probably a good idea, especially for Enemies making noises
Fancy Grass "Blocks" / Crops?
	For once they do quite a lot to reduce the blocky appearance, although this
	would mean more code in the renderpath. How could farming crops be rendered apart from
	angled billboards? 3D Models would be quite a bit of work for every crop although giving much more freedom whilst
	most probably destroying performance without massive optimization work. Needs some more thought for now.
Speedlines?
	Quite a lot of anime/mangas use speedlines to their advantage, might be useful here to underline the speed and agility
	with which one jumps from island to island.
