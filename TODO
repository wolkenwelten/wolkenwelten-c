- Make Mouse sensitivity configurable and reduce the default
- Guarantee that player starts off on a huge island with trees and other essentials
- Change glider recipe to also be craftable with something other than fur
- Have Item names be displayerd on Hover
- Roots drop wooden logs when mined
- InGame tutorial/quests introducing basic game conecepts to the player
- Highlight the currently looked at block

- Precision Value for World generation, can be different for each chungus, the farther any players/animals are the less precise the simulation gets
- Add Clouds Trails from Characters/Entities/Projectiles, probably looks nice
- SHRINK THE BLOCKS!
- Have Wind affect fire spread direction
- Proper water system
- Proper light system
- Add block variations by having each face use a 2x2 texture, and instead of having uv be in the range of 0-1 use 0-0.5 for single blocks, thereby adding some slight variations along the way.
- Properly check if the server is still there and close the connection otherwise
- Make client detect when the connection to the server is separated and show an error instead of just becoming unresponsive
- Animals don't spawn after the limit has been reached, especially problematic if the limit is already reached with animals inside the spawn area which never gets freed
- Simulate/Store Oxygen levels in chunks and have it spread to neighboring chunks, trees/plants increase oxygen, fires/animals/players decrease oxygen

--- Nujel work ---
+ Write "compile" lambda that resolves all symbols for a given λ, which should make things a lot faster
+ Store symbols in a BTree
+ Arguments should all be single greek lowercase letters to easily distinguish them from normal test/code, also it looks kinda schway
+ Native Hashmaps
+ Native Pointers with an associated type ID, which the GC uses for allocing and freeing the native object (especially useful for GUI widgets)
+ TCO?...!

--- Off-stream work ---
+ Fancy Ropes
+ Fix WASM Singleplayer

--- Low Prio Work ---------------------------------------------------------
- Disable players equiping random items in their equipment slots
- Make Bunny populations more stable
- Remove bigChungus from serverSide
- Enable Compression for wasm/ws connections
- Migrate to OpenAL
- Simple Checksums for Savegames
- Implement projectile flag to have the projectile bounce off surfaces
